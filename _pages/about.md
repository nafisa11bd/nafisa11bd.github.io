I have completed my B.Sc in Computer Science & Engineering from [Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology](https://ruet.ac.bd/) in 2022. I am currently seeking opportunities to further my education and research in computer science. My goal is to pursue higher studies, with a particular interest in securing a position as a Research Assistant (RA) or Teaching Assistant (TA). I am excited about the prospect of contributing to academic research and sharing my knowledge with others while continuing to expand my own expertise in this dynamic field. As a former AI Trainer at Remotasks, I gained hands-on experience in analyzing coding-related tasks for training AI models. My research interest includes Deep Learning, application of LLMs in various NLP tasks such as text generation, code generation, sentiment analysis etc. and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
